I was editing some README.md files when I came across a fantastic resource [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/). 

It&amp;#39;s a markdown editor that runs in your browser. Not only does it have a live preview - which is great whenever you are working with markdown files, so great that I am writing this post in Dillinger before I transfer the markdown back to my blog but it also you to connect your Github account and import your markdown files from your repos which makes writing READMEs super easy. 

You can find Dillinger on Github [here](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger) so you can see how it was built and you can setup it up locally.

I hope you enjoy using it as much as I do.
